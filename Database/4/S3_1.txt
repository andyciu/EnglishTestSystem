    In some countries where food abounds, obesity has become a problem for a great number of people. With more and more people getting fatter and fatter, they may easily suffer from heart disease, which is often caused by taking in plenty of fat. Under such circumstances, some dietary experts have proposed adding tax to fatty food. They believe that if value added tax is put on fatty food, people will reduce their consumption of fat. They will cut down on such food as full fat milk, cheese, butter, biscuits, buns, cakes, pastries, puddings, and ice cream. If these things become higher-priced because of the added fat tax, the public will be more likely to buy cheaper, lower fat alternatives. 
    However, some doctors do not believe in fat tax. They argue that the proposal above fails to take into account genetic factors that make some people more likely to get heart disease than others. They also point out that when people switch to lower fat alternatives, they tend to eat more, so they end up taking in the same levels of fat. With such divided opinions about the practicability of fat tax, an article in The Atlantic even ironically suggests taxing not fattening foods or fattening companies, but fat people. The author argues that it is they, after all, who drive up the government's health-care costs, so it is they, fat people, who should pay. The author, apparently a slim person, even proposes taxing people by the pound !
