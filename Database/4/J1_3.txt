                Save the Forests!!
                     By Annie Chan

Trees are important to us.

They clean the air.
They also help clean the rainwater.
Trees make the world more beautiful.
We feel good when we see tall green trees.

There are now fewer and fewer trees in the "forests".
Because we cut down a lot of them to build houses
and make paper.

Many animals lose their homes
And have a hard time finding food to eat.
The animals cry for help, but few people listen.

We can¡¦t let things go on like "this". 
Let¡¦s do something, my friends!
Grow more trees and care for them.

Use both side of paper.
Reuse boxes and paper bags, too.
Help save the forests, my friends.
Help us save the earth!
