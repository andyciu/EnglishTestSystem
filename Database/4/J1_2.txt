  It・s hot in summer. You enjoy going to the beach. The water is cool, the sun is comfortable, and you are having a good time. But when you come home, your skin hurts. Why?
  It・s because of the UV light, especially UVA and UVB. UVA makes your skin look old. UVB gives a sunburn. That・s why your skin becomes red and hurts. What・s worse, they can cause skin cancer. 
  It sounds scary, but don・t worry. There are things you can do. For example, wear long sleeves or bring an umbrella when you go out. Stay away from the sun at noon. Pun sunscreen on your skin. Make sure it has a PA and an SPF. Don・t forget to use it every few hours. That way, UV light won・t hurt your skin.
